# NYC Airbnb Listings Analysis (2019)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb listings across New York City using a dataset from 2019. The goal was to explore pricing trends, listing availability, review behavior, and neighborhood-level patterns to better understand the dynamics of the short-term rental market in NYC.

I used **Python** for data cleaning and exploratory analysis, and **Tableau** to design an interactive dashboard that visualizes key trends across boroughs and room types.

## Dashboard Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following charts:

1. **Average Price by Borough**  
   Visualizes average Airbnb prices by NYC borough, noting that neighborhoods like Neponsit and Willowbrook have high averages but low listing counts.

2. **Room Type Popularity Based on Availability**  
   Compares how often each room type is available, showing a near-equal split between private rooms and entire homes/apartments.

3. **Do Higher-Priced Listings Get More Reviews?**  
   Explores the relationship between listing price and review count across different room types.

4. **Number of Listings by Borough**  
   Shows boroughs with the most listings, highlighting the Financial District as a hotspot.

## Key Insights

- **High Prices â‰  Low Reviews**: Higher-priced listings, especially entire homes/apartments, still attract significant reviews.
- **Private Rooms Dominate Availability**: They slightly edge out entire homes, suggesting theyâ€™re a popular choice for travelers.
- **Financial District is a Listing Hub**: With over 69,000 listings, itâ€™s a central node in NYCâ€™s Airbnb market.
- **Neighborhood Size Matters**: Some expensive neighborhoods have few listings, so averages may be skewed.
